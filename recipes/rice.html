        <p>
            This is my go to dish when I am feeling motivated to workout. This is one of the most healthy dish you could eat while working out, and it's rather simple.
            It's made out of rice, broccoli, chicken and that's it! But I won't lie to you, this dish can get boring sometimes, but that's why there are so many
            variatons to this dish, you can make it i a lot of way. Today I'm gonna show you the honey chicken way.
