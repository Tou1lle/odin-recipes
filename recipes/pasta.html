        <p>
            This is one of my favourite dish. It's inspired by Gigi Hadid's pasta dish. Pasta can be made in a lot of different ways,
            and the way I do it is making in really spicy. The only downside to this dish is that it is kinda messy, so you need to organize your 
            kitchen smart. I like to add chicken breasts to this dish to have some more protein, but consider it optional.
